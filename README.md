This project is a relational database management system designed for a railway transport company, developed as part of a school assignment in database design.
While the database structure closely models the real-world requirements of a railway operation, some simplifications have been made to ensure clarity and manageability within an academic context.

he company’s operations are segmented by timeframes: passenger transport is conducted from 6:00 AM to 9:00 PM, while freight transport occurs from 9:00 PM to 6:00 AM, each with specific logistical requirements that the database is structured to support.
The core of the database is built around a detailed Entity-Relationship (ER) model that captures essential aspects of railway operations. 
Trains are uniquely identified by codes and categorized by type, with passenger trains and freight trains each having attributes suited to their function. 
Passenger trains, for example, include data on carriage capacity and maximum passenger counts, ensuring that ticket sales remain within defined limits. 
Meanwhile, freight trains are structured with wagon capacity and rental income data, supporting the company’s need to track revenue from leasing wagons to various clients.

Stations and routes form a central aspect of the database, simulating the railway network’s infrastructure. Each station is documented with geographic coordinates, track numbers, and assigned station managers, while the routes consist of specific segments between stations, capturing scheduled and actual times, ticket prices, and assigned trains. This structure allows the company to maintain a comprehensive record of each train’s journey, ensuring both scheduling accuracy and streamlined station management.

To enhance data consistency and enforce operational rules, the database incorporates a variety of constraints and triggers. For instance, time-based triggers ensure that passenger trains operate strictly within daytime hours and freight trains during nighttime hours. This emulation of real-world constraints supports realistic database behavior, ensuring that the company’s operational rules are consistently applied. Additional constraints guard against overbooking by checking that train and wagon capacities are not exceeded, a necessary measure to maintain safe and efficient operations.

The project also leverages SQL stored procedures and queries to streamline data interaction and support insightful reporting. A specific procedure monitors train delays, identifying cases where a train’s arrival exceeds the scheduled time by more than 10 minutes. Other queries aggregate revenue from ticket sales and maintenance costs, offering profitability insights over specified periods. This blend of analytical and operational functionality allows the railway company to track profitability and efficiency with ease, even though the database has been simplified for the academic setting.

This database design emphasizes normalization to the third normal form (3NF), reducing data redundancy while ensuring that information is logically grouped and easily accessible. Primary and foreign keys are implemented throughout the schema to establish clear relationships between entities, supporting data integrity across the system. The final database includes SQL scripts for table creation, constraints, triggers, and procedures, providing a robust framework that meets both functional needs and academic requirements.

While the project includes intentional simplifications to maintain focus and manageability, such as aggregated data on financial operations and generalized attributes for certain entities, it remains a valuable exploration of database design for a transport environment. This project balances functional realism with academic feasibility, delivering an educational but technically sound database system that demonstrates the core principles of relational database management, constraint enforcement, and SQL scripting for operational and analytical tasks.
